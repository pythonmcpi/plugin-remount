# Plugin Remount

A powercord plugin that adds a remount command, used for remounting (reloading) other plugins.

You should probably use [remount](https://github.com/x6r/remount) instead. It has more features, including an auto-remount setting.
I forgot to check for the existence of other plugins with the same functionality until I finished this plugin, so I'm going to publish this one on github anyway.
